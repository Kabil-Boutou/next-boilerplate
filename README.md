# Project Title

Only the getting started section of README is talkig about this actual project the rest of it is just a template for later use...

## Getting Started

This boilerplate contains all the necessary to start a NextJs project and more, as you can see it has all the configs files ( eslint, prettier, docker-compose, now...) so you can change it easily and have the same setup as all your teammates. I also included a some useful dependencies such as bundle-analyzer to analyze bundle size on the client and server side simply by running ( npm run analyze or yarn analyze ), husky for pre-commits and such, commitizen/cz-cli to unify the commits messages (when you to commit you don't need use git commit instead of commit -m '...' and follow the instruction shown in terminal)
